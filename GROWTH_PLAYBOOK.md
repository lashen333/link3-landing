# Link3 Growth Playbook: 0 to 10k Signups

This playbook outlines 5 high-impact experiments to reach the goal of 10,000 verified waitlist signups in 90 days.

## Experiment 1: The "Creator VIP" Drop
**Hypothesis**: Creators crave exclusivity and status.
**Action**:
1.  Identify 50 mid-tier creators (15k-100k followers) in specific niches (e.g., Digital Art, Music Production).
2.  DM them a "VIP Access" link that gives them a reserved handle and a "Founding Creator" badge.
3.  **Incentive**: They get 5 "Golden Tickets" to invite their creator friends.
**Metric**: Conversion rate from DM to Signup > 20%. Viral coefficient > 1.5 within this cohort.

## Experiment 2: The "Remix Challenge" (Viral Loop)
**Hypothesis**: Users will share if they can showcase their creativity.
**Action**:
1.  Launch a weekly "Remix Challenge" on Twitter/X and TikTok.
2.  Provide a simple asset (e.g., a beat or a visual loop) from the landing page assets.
3.  Ask users to "Remix this and tag #Link3".
4.  **Reward**: Top 3 remixes get instant access + $100 in OPX tokens (future allocation).
**Metric**: #Link3 mentions and traffic from social to landing page.

## Experiment 3: "Proof of Origin" Controversy
**Hypothesis**: The problem of stolen content is emotional and polarizing.
**Action**:
1.  Create a Twitter thread/LinkedIn post highlighting a recent high-profile case of AI art theft or stolen content.
2.  Position Link3 as the *only* solution with "Immutable Proof of Origin".
3.  Boost the post with paid ads targeting "Artists" and "Designers".
**Metric**: CTR > 2%. Signup conversion from this specific ad set > 8%.

## Experiment 4: The Referral Leaderboard (Gamification)
**Hypothesis**: Competition drives sharing.
**Action**:
1.  Enable a public (or private email-based) leaderboard showing the top referrers.
2.  **Prize**: Top 10 referrers each week get "Lifetime Zero Fees" on their Creator Shop.
3.  Send a weekly email update: "You are 3 referrals away from the Top 10."
**Metric**: Average referrals per user (Viral K-factor) increases from 1.0 to 1.2.

## Experiment 5: Community "Build in Public"
**Hypothesis**: Transparency builds trust and ownership.
**Action**:
1.  Share the "Roadmap" and "Design System" (like this landing page) on Product Hunt and Hacker News.
2.  Title: "We're building the anti-platform. Here's our code."
3.  Ask for feedback on the "Fair Split" algorithm.
**Metric**: Traffic spike (2k+ visitors in 24h). 15% conversion rate from tech-savvy early adopters.
